## Anonymity Choice

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### How did respondents identify themselves?

Respondents were given the choice to remain anonymous or state their name. The majority chose to remain anonymous, which likely encouraged more honest and critical feedback.

**Breakdown:**
- **Anonymous:** ~60-65% ("I'll keep myself Anonymous")
- **Named:** ~35-40% (Provided name or nickname)
- **Redacted Information:** Some respondents chose to leave their name, role and clan, but as per anonymity sake, all identifying information was redacted prior to data handling.

  <div class="stat-card">
    <span class="stat-number">~55%</span>
    <span class="stat-label">Stayed in Original Clan</span>
  </div>
</div>

**Why Members Move:**

### Reasons for Clan Changes

</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
"I was in Reapers but they disbanded due to lack of active players" - Former Reapers member
</div>

**2. Inactivity Issues**
<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
"Sol felt very inactive" - Member explaining move from Sol
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
"Mayhem" (moved due to inactivity) - Brief explanation
</div>

**3. Seeking Better Fit**
<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
"I left wolves, Joined apex, than took a break from d2 and joined wolves again" - Former Wolves officer
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
"Was alienated by clanmates and after the switch even more so by them" - Member describing negative experience
</div>

**4. Helping Other Clans**

</div>

</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
