## Clan Wars - Feedback

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Overall Assessment: **Not Well-Received**

<div class="alert alert-critical" markdown="1">
Clan Wars was the most negatively mentioned event in the survey.
</div>

### Frequency of Negative Feedback
**Very High**
Appeared in ~20% of open-ended responses

### Primary Issues

#### **1. Conflicting Goals - Competition vs Community Building**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Clan Wars seemed like an event that would be something that would have the Clans duking it out in the spirit of competition and then next thing you know we have the event organizer coming in and telling us that it was meant to be a community building event. Not a competition. What a joke.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Clan Wars is such a bad idea of an event if you want to have the community come together and not be competitive. It's absurdly stupid to think that people wouldn't get competitive about it.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Competitive events are good and all but the way Clan Wars got handled and was advertised just fell flat and makes me think that Wrecked is being a sanctimonious prick about it.
</div>

---

#### **2. Burnout and Mandatory Grinding**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
The most unfun one because it pretty much forces people to keep grinding the game out more than they usually would and that can lead to people being burnt out or in the worst case quitting the clan.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Clan wars was a joke NEVER should have returned more often then not these events are big L's.
</div>

---

#### **3. Created Hostility Between Clans**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
After this years clan wars it just feels hostile or maybe just a little bit toxic seeing what certain clans did.
</div>

---

#### **4. Poorly Executed**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Clan Wars is such a bad idea of an event if you want to have the community come together and not be competitive.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Clan wars was a joke NEVER should have returned.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
Clan Wars was considered by the community initially a good idea of an event. A friendly competition between clans.
However, due to its competitive nature, certain clans raised the bar to the point where members felt the demands on them were unreasonable and unrealistic. It became a mandatory list of "To-Do's", rather than a fun event to voluntary partake in. 
Instead of building community, event damaged cross-clan relationships and created lasting resentment.
</div>
</div>

## POTW/POTM Streams

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Player of the Week/Month Stream Feedback

**Overall Reception:** Mixed

### Positive Aspects

- Recognition for community members is appreciated
- Respondents enjoyed having a regular community gathering point
- Prize giveaways appreciated

### Concerns Raised

#### **1. Stream Length and Focus**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Speed up the results, it shouldn't be greener talking about giving our money away to them for 2 hours and than 5 mins of results. It's less of a POTW OR POTM stream more of a hey donate, hey do this, I need money PLEASE.
</div>

**Pain Point:** Stream feels lengthy and unbalanced as far as content. Recognition is no longer the main focus. Asks for donation or support in other ways now take up a larger portion. These are normally fine to include, however, some respondents seem to feel that it has gotten to the point where the whole thing can seem disingenuous rather than a fun community interaction.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Frontload the POTW/POTM announcements and recognition
- Reduce non community-related content time
- Balance content better

---

#### **2. Destiny Doesn't Cut It Anymore**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I feel like it should be in the middle. Where we can play Destiny, but also play other games with clanmates
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
Concerns regarding SGC moving towards a Multi-Game Community were expressed by multiple respondents. These are exposed on the "Future Direction" Tab of the Survey Results.
  
<a href="future-direction" class="btn">Future Direction →</a>
</div>


---

#### **3. Timezone Limitations**

- Some members can't attend due to timezone differences
- EU members particularly affected
- Rather Fancy Cat's EU streams noted as alternative

**Suggested Fix:**
- Rotate stream times occasionally
- Post highlights/VODs with timestamps
- Consider multiple regional streams

</div>

---

## Podcast Feedback

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### SGC Podcast Reception

**Overall Reception:** Low to Mixed

### Primary Concerns

#### **1. Relevance Question**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Stop with coping about it, accept reality and put that effort into something that will matter.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
If was like the Shrouded version of Datto or interactive thing for people, podcasts would make sense.
</div>

**Issue:** Podcast about dying game feels like denial rather than adaptation. Content doesn't match community needs.

---

#### **2. Lack of Interactive Element**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
If was like the Shrouded version of Datto or interactive thing for people, podcasts would make sense.
</div>

**Issue:** Podcast is one-directional. Community wants to participate, not just listen.

---

### Member Suggestion

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
It would be great to combine the POTW streams and the podcast, creating a hybrid experience that includes a dedicated segment for live interaction with viewers.
</div>

**Recommended Approach:**
- Merge podcast with POTW stream for efficiency
- Add live Q&A segments
- Include community guests
- Diversify topics beyond Destiny

</div>

## Event Organizer Feedback

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Specific Concerns About Event Leadership

**Mister Wrecked (Primary Event Organizer):**

Multiple complaints about event organization and handling:

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Clan Wars seemed like an event that would be something that would have the Clans duking it out in the spirit of competition and then next thing you know we have the event organizer coming in and telling us that it was meant to be a community building event. Not a competition. What a joke.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Competitive events are good and all but the way Clan Wars got handled and was advertised just fell flat and makes me think that Wrecked is being a sanctimonious prick about it.
</div>

**Pattern:** Event design and messaging problems linked to specific organizer. Consider:
- Rotating event organizers
- Community input on event design
- Multiple people planning events
- Feedback loops during planning phase

</div>

---

## Event Calendar Suggestions

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**Weekly:**

**Bi-Weekly:**
- Cross-clan collaborative events

- Multi-gaming events

**Monthly:**
- POTM Stream

</div>

---

## Destiny vs Multi-Gaming Events

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### The Balance Challenge

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
<strong>TENSION:</strong> Community wants to move beyond Destiny, but most established events are Destiny-focused.
</div>

**Current Reality:**
- POTW/POTM = Destiny achievements
- Podcast = Destiny discussion
- Most teaching events = Destiny content
- Clan Wars = Destiny activity

**Community Desire:**
- Multi-gaming events
- Recognition for non-Destiny accomplishments
- Content relevant to games they're actually playing

**Recommended Shift:**
- Gradually introduce multi-gaming recognition in POTW/POTM
- Theme some weeks around other games
- Create parallel event tracks
- Don't abandon Destiny entirely, but diversify

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I like having some of the community games be on other games, but to play those I have to also play all the time on destiny to stay in the clan. Just makes it hard to enjoy other games.
</div>

**This quote captures the tension:** Members want to participate in SGC events for other games without jeopardizing their clan membership.

</div>
