# Survey Results Feedback: We want to hear from you

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
This page contains a link to a form where you can have your thoughts shared with the people responsable for the presentation of the data of this survey.
Once again, anonymity is your right. We do not want you to feel forced, obligated, cohersed, unsafe to reveal any sort of identity.

**However...** depending on the severity of your feedback or the type of issue you are reporting, please consider that we'd need some help from you to work on these concerns.
And in such a case, it may be best for you to leave a way of contacting you (SGC Name, Discord Handle, Email, Signal, etc...)
