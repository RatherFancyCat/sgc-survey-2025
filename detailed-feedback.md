## Major Themes Overview

### 1. Multi-Gaming Transition - URGENT & CRITICAL

<div class="card">

**Frequency:** Very High (~25% of feedback providers)

**Sentiment:** Strong urgency that SGC must evolve beyond Destiny to survive

<div class="quote-box">
"The entire focus of SGC being 'Greeners streaming server' is just not gonna work, with destiny dying... the community was mainly focused on the game, that game is now dying, the only 2 options there are right now is to either adapt or die with it."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I don't want SGC to die off with destiny, I want to keep my close friends from here. That's it. If destiny succeeds and revives itself which god I'm hoping it does. Id still love for other games, because SGC as a whole is amazing to me and is dear to me, for it to be in the hands of bungie or destiny does not make me feel warm and fuzzy."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"SGC needs to embrace being a community of people playing different games and working with that rather than trying to cling to a dying game and slowly dying with it."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Make this a gaming community not a destiny 2 community."
</div>

**Key Insight:** Members have formed genuine friendships and don't want the community to die with the game.

</div>

### 2. Mister Wrecked - Significant Leadership Concern

<div class="card">

<div class="alert alert-critical">
<strong>CRITICAL:</strong> This is the single most mentioned individual in negative feedback.
</div>

**Frequency:** High (~15-20% of final feedback)

**Pattern:** Accusations of power abuse, favoritism, hypocrisy, ego, poor attitude, and being unapproachable.

<div class="quote-box">
"Make this a gaming community not a destiny 2 community and get wrecked out of power it's bad for business!"
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Wrecked he's lousy at being an admin he's cruel unfair and unreasonable most times. I feel that he should have never been giving any form of power and should be stripped of it immediately he's an extreme detriment to this gaming community."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"The only one that needs gone from that list is wrecked he shouldn't have any form of power he brings the whole community down. He's a bad person a hypocrite, liar and overall bad dude."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Clan Wars seemed like an event that would be something that would have the Clans duking it out in the spirit of competition and then next thing you know we have the event organizer coming in and telling us that it was meant to be a community building event. Not a competition. What a joke."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"From what I see in chats and have experienced both wrecked and Hoppe are very egotistical fake and absolutely rude."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"It's a very unpleasant atmosphere... It doesn't help we are forced to play destiny 2 which is utterly and completely basically dead. Very very bad look for a community... having wrecked in that form of power will completely crush the SGC."
</div>

**Counter-perspectives (minority):**

<div class="quote-box">
"Wrecked is cool af the 'role abusing pussy' he has the power & I've seen him 1st hand he will use it in the funniest of ways great dude."
</div>

**Action Required:** Several respondents specifically call for removal from leadership.

</div>

---

### 3. Clan Wars - Post-Mortem Feedback

<div class="card">

**Frequency:** Moderate-High

**Consensus:** Event was fundamentally flawed in design with mixed messaging about competition vs. community building.

<div class="quote-box">
"Clan wars was a joke NEVER should have returned more often then not these events are big L's."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Clan Wars is such a bad idea of an event if you want to have the community come together and not be competitive. It's absurdly stupid to think that people wouldn't get competitive about it."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Competitive events are good and all but the way Clan Wars got handled and was advertised just fell flat and makes me think that Wrecked is being a sanctimonious prick about it."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"The most unfun one because it pretty much forces people to keep grinding the game out more than they usually would and that can lead to people being burnt out or in the worst case quitting the clan."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"After this years clan wars it just feels hostile or maybe just a little bit toxic seeing what certain clans did."
</div>

**Suggestion from community:**

<div class="quote-box">
"Maybe have it being tied to one activity a week with teams who are already made up so those people in particular can represent the clan... That way you can control who wants to participate."
</div>

</div>

### 4. Positive Reinforcement - Love for SGC

<div class="card">

**Frequency:** Moderate

Despite criticisms, many members expressed genuine affection:

<div class="quote-box">
"I love the SGC, I do... But the amount of sexual talk, butt sex crap and other non gaming shit needs to stop."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I love being a part of the SGC. I am thankful that to have been trusted with the responsibility of being OMENs admin."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Let me preface by saying, I love the SGC."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I just wanted to say that this is the first clan/community that I have truly enjoyed being part of, regardless of the ups and downs."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I think overall, the SGC has done an amazing job. I understand the complexity of running such a large community."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"SGC accommodated me and many of my friends after disagreements with the previous community we were at with an open arm and I'm grateful for that."
</div>

**Pattern:** People genuinely care about SGC and want it to succeed. Criticisms come from investment, not apathy.

</div>

### 5. NSFW Content & Moderation Failure

<div class="card">

<div class="alert alert-critical">
<strong>CRITICAL SEVERITY:</strong> Complete moderation failure with mental health impact
</div>

**Frequency:** Low but **EXTREMELY SERIOUS**

<div class="quote-box">
"Reading the Apex text chat made me feel bad, very bad and I started to lose energy and become lethargic... Because it's a Destiny text chat NOT a porn text chat. To have soft porn on our chat day and night and in between, relentless and unstopping is not what I signed up for. This is Ellie I'm talking about. Her constant and desperate need for attention... I do not want to know how she plays with herself. I don't want to know what will happen if you tie a penis in a knot and then try to pee..."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"It was literally destroying my mental health... And where are the moderators or admin staff? They are silent. In fact they mainly support her."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"And the SGC rule clearly states no NSFW content... staying silent or encouraging her means it's supported and ok."
</div>

**Impact:** Member stopped participating in clan text chat entirely.

**Action Required:** Immediate investigation and enforcement.

</div>

---

### 6. Podcast & Stream Feedback

<div class="card">

**Frequency:** Low-Moderate

<div class="quote-box">
"Stop with coping about it, accept reality and put that effort into something that will matter." (re: podcast about dying game)
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"If was like the Shrouded version of Datto or interactive thing for people, podcasts would make sense."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Speed up the results, it shouldn't be greener talking about giving our money away to them for 2 hours and than 5 mins of results. It's less of a POTW OR POTM stream more of a hey donate, hey do this, I need money PLEASE."
</div>

**Suggestion:**

<div class="quote-box">
"It would be great to combine the POTW streams and the podcast, creating a hybrid experience that includes a dedicated segment for live interaction with viewers."
</div>

</div>

---

### 7. Cross-Clan Culture Issues

<div class="card">

**Frequency:** Moderate

<div class="quote-box">
"There are a large group of SGC members that tend to be incredibly elitist and will publicly mock other SGC members."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Several clans are not respectful towards members of SGC outside their own clan and can express elitism and talk down on other members... so I generally stay within my own clan chat."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I hate leaving the confines of where my clan is because everywhere else feels like hate towards me."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"We are a mega-clan, and yet it seems some admins seem to take the mentality of 'we are X' and want little to do with the rest of the community."
</div>

**Suggestion:**

<div class="quote-box">
"I think ever clan needs at least 1 VC that is open to all players, especially in an instance where 5 from clan X need 1 more and they grab someone from clan y."
</div>

</div>

---

### 8. Activity Requirements & Multi-Gaming Tension

<div class="card">

**Frequency:** Moderate

<div class="quote-box">
"I like having some of the community games be on other games, but to play those I have to also play all the time on destiny to stay in the clan. Just makes it hard to enjoy other games."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I like the group in Bastion, I just wish it didn't have its own set of participation rules that have to be met each week before you play with other sgc communities."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Instead of having rules for each clan, have all the clans have the same set of rules."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"It would be nice to have the clan open to playing other multiplayer games and not have to worry about getting removed because I'm not on Destiny as much anymore."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I wish that there was a way for us to track/count time spent in games if we are spending time with a member of the SGC... A way for us to enjoy our times together and have it all count towards our activity."
</div>

</div>

---

### 9. Positive Leadership Mentions

<div class="card">

**Who was praised:**

**Xiamara (Division Leader):**
<div class="quote-box">
"Xiamara - outstanding admin, I go to her majority of the time for my issues."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Xia is amazing no doubt there."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Xia hardest working person in staff."
</div>

**Rather Fancy Cat:**
<div class="quote-box">
"Fancy cat is super easy to talk to."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Rather Fancy best sgc streamer ever is a 5 for me super duper approachable."
</div>

**Devilito (Moderator):**
<div class="quote-box">
"Devilito is pretty awesome - Very approachable."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Devilito is the reason I knew I won the shaker."
</div>

**Pattern:** When leadership is accessible and fair, members notice and appreciate it deeply.

</div>

---

### 10. Favoritism & Accountability

<div class="card">

**Frequency:** Moderate but **SERIOUS**

<div class="quote-box">
"Favoritism is clear within the SGC Admins from my perspective."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I get they are all friends, but at the end of the day the admins should be treated like managers of a job, if they are wrong they should be punished, not ban the people that spoke up."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Members of staff (Officer and up) breaking SGC Code of Conduct and getting a slap on the wrist when others would have been kicked/banned. Rules are seemingly lax when a staff member is the offender."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I don't trust Jango, who broke a critical core rule of the SGC and kept his role."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"A good leader lifts the entire team, not just a select few. If Wrecked doesn't want to be a good leader, but continue on his current role, then consider giving the role to someone who genuinely cares about the community."
</div>

**Pattern:** Perception (or reality) that rules apply differently to staff/friends of leadership breeds resentment and distrust.

</div>

## Event Suggestions from Community

<div class="card">

<div class="quote-box">
"Raid zero to hero. Would be very fun to game with the homies and face a new challenge I haven't done yet in raids."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I would like a bit more events like the zero to hero dungeon event that was fun."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"GAMBIT! VIIs and sentinels did. Same with apex. Get a private match gambit going."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Hide and seek an ADMIN have a stream slot and have hud off, post it out or giveaway first one to find yall in the open world gets a small reward."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"More party nights like maybe a fall guys or destiny gambit night would be fun."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Would be cool to have some flawless/challenge/triumph runs. A lot of people need help completing seals."
</div>

**Pattern:** Members want collaborative/fun events, not high-pressure competitive ones.

</div>

---

## Destiny 2 State - Impact on Community

<div class="card">

**Frequency:** Very High

<div class="quote-box">
"The game is dead in my opinion. Myself and several others do link up and play BF, TFD and Warframe."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"It sucks, and I play other games more often. I hope it changes."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"The game is dead or is dying it's force fed from this 'GAMING COMMUNITY'."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Destiny is dead, its getting beat by cookie clicker."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I can hardly even bring myself to launch the game."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"The only reason I still have it is because of SGC."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I love this game, but this dlc destroyed my trust in bungie."
</div>

**Pattern:** Community's foundation game is failing. Members are staying **for each other, not for Destiny**.

</div>

---

## Specific Clan Issues

<div class="card">

**RISE:**
<div class="quote-box">
"The clan is dead, and there is zero activity from the officers. They don't even touch anything destiny related... Rise is barely active and just a few people talking everyday."
</div>

**FURY:**
<div class="quote-box">
"Wish people played other games together too."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"My clan seems very unengaged across all roles at this time."
</div>

**APEX:**
<div class="quote-box">
"Multiple mentions of the inappropriate content issue."
</div>

**WRTH (Wraiths):**
<div class="quote-box">
"We don't really trust the word of the SGC admins anymore and typically avoid them unless absolutely necessary."
</div>

**BSTN (Bastion):**
<div class="quote-box">
"The in clan requirements... Makes the clan seem elitist."
</div>

**SLS (Souls):**
<div class="quote-box">
"Sometimes being a part of SLS doesnt really feel very welcoming. Its full of high level players and while playing with them is fun, sometimes I get the feeling im just burden in the runs."
</div>

</div>

## Most Powerful Closing Statements

<div class="card">

<div class="quote-box">
"I think I have a lot more words for this question but I really don't know how to put them in writing. This is THE biggest issue I face right now." (On multi-gaming tension)
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"This thing that's been created could be so much more than what it is. I'm not saying I have all the answers on how to get there from here. Honestly, I haven't the foggiest clue. But I don't think this is working as intended presently."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"Thank you for this survey and for giving me a voice. When I felt like I didn't have one."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"SGC has been great in my experience, but people can definitely be a mixed bag."
</div>

<div class="quote-box">
"I just wanted to say that this is the first clan/community that I have truly enjoyed being part of, regardless of the ups and downs that have taken place over my years with this community."
</div>

</div>

## Final Assessment

<div class="alert alert-warning">

The feedback reveals a community at a **crossroads**:

- ✅ **Strong foundation:** Genuine friendships, meaningful connections, appreciation for what SGC has built
- ⚠️ **Existential crisis:** Foundation game is dying, must evolve or face dissolution
- ⚠️ **Leadership crisis:** Specific concerns about favoritism, accountability, and one particular admin
- ⚠️ **Cultural crisis:** Elitism and division undermining "mega-clan" concept
- 🚨 **Moderation crisis:** NSFW content going unaddressed

**But there's hope:** The fact that 128 people took time to complete a detailed survey shows they care. They're not apathetic—they're invested.

The window to address these issues is **now**, while people still care enough to give feedback.
