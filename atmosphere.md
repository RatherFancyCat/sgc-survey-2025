<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I just wanted to say that this is the first clan/community that I have truly enjoyed being part of, regardless of the ups and downs that have taken place over my years with this community.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
It's a very unpleasant atmosphere... It doesn't help we are forced to play destiny 2 which is utterly and completely basically dead.
</div>

## 2. In-Clan Interactions

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Rating Distribution

| Rating | Count | Percentage | Description |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------|
| 5 - Excellent | ~55 | 43% | 🟢 Very positive |
| 4 - Good | ~45 | 35% | 🟢 Positive |
| 3 - Mixed | ~20 | 16% | 🟡 Neutral/Mixed |
| 2 - Poor | ~6 | 5% | 🔴 Negative |
| 1 - Very Poor | ~2 | 1% | 🔴 Very negative |

**Average Score: 4.2-4.3 / 5** (Good to Excellent)

### Analysis

**This is SGC's strongest metric:**
- **78% rated their in-clan experience as good or excellent**
- Only 6% rated it as poor or very poor
- Clear indication that individual clans are doing well internally

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
My clan is super welcoming and friendly, I love them all!
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
The people in my clan are amazing and supportive. Best group I've ever been part of.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
VII has been nothing but welcoming and helpful since I joined.
</div>

**Why In-Clan Works Well:**
- Smaller, tight-knit groups foster friendships
- Shared clan identity and goals
- Regular interaction in clan-specific channels
- Clan leadership typically accessible
- "Safe space" within larger community

**Few Negative Experiences:**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Rise is barely active and just a few people talking everyday.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Sometimes being a part of SLS doesnt really feel very welcoming. Its full of high level players and while playing with them is fun, sometimes I get the feeling im just burden in the runs.
</div>

## 3. Cross-Clan Interactions

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Rating Distribution

| Rating | Count | Percentage | Description |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------|
| 5 - Excellent | ~15 | 12% | 🟢 Very positive |
| 4 - Good | ~35 | 27% | 🟢 Positive |
| 3 - Mixed | ~50 | 39% | 🟡 Neutral/Mixed |
| 2 - Poor | ~20 | 16% | 🔴 Negative |
| 1 - Very Poor | ~8 | 6% | 🔴 Very negative |

**Average Score: 3.1-3.2 / 5** (Mixed)

### Analysis

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
<strong>This is SGC's weakest metric</strong> - Cross-clan interactions are notably worse than in-clan experiences.
</div>

**The Problem:**
- Only 39% rate cross-clan interactions positively
- 39% have mixed feelings (neutral, inconsistent experiences)
- 22% rate it as poor or very poor
- **Gap of 1.1 points between in-clan (4.3) and cross-clan (3.2) scores**

**Why Cross-Clan Struggles:**

### Issue #1: Elitism & Division

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
There are a large group of SGC members that tend to be incredibly elitist and will publicly mock other SGC members.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Several clans are not respectful towards members of SGC outside their own clan and can express elitism and talk down on other members... so I generally stay within my own clan chat.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I hate leaving the confines of where my clan is because everywhere else feels like hate towards me.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
We are a mega-clan, and yet it seems some admins seem to take the mentality of 'we are X' and want little to do with the rest of the community.
</div>

### Issue #2: Cliquishness

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Some people only want to play with people from their clan and don't really branch out.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Cross clan has always been weird to me because we aren't just 1 clan we are like 20. So we have these groups that only know each other but rarely intermingle.
</div>

### Issue #3: Toxic Behavior

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
After this years clan wars it just feels hostile or maybe just a little bit toxic seeing what certain clans did.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Was alienated by clanmates and after the switch even more so by them.
</div>

### Issue #4: Structural Barriers

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I think ever clan needs at least 1 VC that is open to all players, especially in an instance where 5 from clan X need 1 more and they grab someone from clan y.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
The bastion requirements... Makes the clan seem elitist.
</div>

**Positive Cross-Clan Experiences (Minority):**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I've had nothing but positive interactions with other clans.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Everyone I've played with from other clans has been great.
</div>

</div>

## 4. Individual Clan Atmosphere

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Rating Distribution

| Rating | Count | Percentage | Description |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------|
| 5 - Excellent | ~60 | 47% | 🟢 Very positive |
| 4 - Good | ~40 | 31% | 🟢 Positive |
| 3 - Mixed | ~20 | 16% | 🟡 Neutral/Mixed |
| 2 - Poor | ~6 | 5% | 🔴 Negative |
| 1 - Very Poor | ~2 | 1% | 🔴 Very negative |

**Average Score: 4.3-4.4 / 5** (Excellent)

### Analysis

**This is SGC's HIGHEST rated metric:**
- **78% rate their individual clan atmosphere as excellent or good**
- Nearly half (47%) gave the highest possible rating
- Only 6% rated poorly

**What This Tells Us:**

✅ **Individual clans are thriving** - The clan system works well at the micro level

✅ **Members love their clan homes** - Strong local community bonds

❌ **The "mega-clan" concept struggles** - Unity breaks down at the macro level

**The Paradox:**
- Members LOVE their individual clans (4.4/5)
- Members struggle with cross-clan interactions (3.2/5)
- This 1.2 point gap reveals SGC operates more like **20 separate clans** than **1 unified community**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
My clan specifically is amazing. The broader SGC... not so much.
</div>
