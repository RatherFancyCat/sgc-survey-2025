## Detailed Analysis

### Elitism
Elitism has been identified as a significant issue within certain clans. Members often feel excluded due to the informal hierarchies that exist, which can discourage participation from newer or less experienced members.

### Division Issues
There are noticeable divisions between clans, which can lead to feelings of isolation among members who may seek broader interactions. Some clans have a more closed-off atmosphere, making it difficult for outsiders to engage and participate.

### Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Encourage Cross-Clan Events**: Implement regular events that involve members from different clans to improve relationships and strengthen community bonds.
2. **Mentorship Programs**: Establish mentorship programs to help newer members feel more included and supported.
3. **Open Forums**: Create open forums for discussion about elitism and division to encourage members to speak up and contribute to a more inclusive atmosphere for everyone.
