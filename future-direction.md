## The Case for Multi-Gaming (From Members)

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Urgency and Necessity

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
The entire focus of SGC being 'Greeners streaming server' is just not gonna work, with destiny dying... the community was mainly focused on the game, that game is now dying, the only 2 options there are right now is to either adapt or die with it.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I don't want SGC to die off with destiny, I want to keep my close friends from here. That's it. If destiny succeeds and revives itself which god I'm hoping it does. Id still love for other games, because SGC as a whole is amazing to me and is dear to me, for it to be in the hands of bungie or destiny does not make me feel warm and fuzzy.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
SGC needs to embrace being a community of people playing different games and working with that rather than trying to cling to a dying game and slowly dying with it.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Make this a gaming community not a destiny 2 community.
</div>

---

### Preserving Community, Not the Game

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I don't want SGC to die off with destiny, I want to keep my close friends from here.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
The only reason I still have it [Destiny] is because of SGC.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I can hardly even bring myself to launch the game.
</div>

**Key Insight:** Members are staying for each other, not for Destiny. The community has transcended the game.

---

### Current Reality: Already Playing Other Games

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
The game is dead in my opinion. Myself and several others do link up and play BF, TFD and Warframe.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
It sucks, and I play other games more often. I hope it changes.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Wish people played other games together too.
</div>

**Reality Check:** Members are already playing other games together. SGC policy just hasn't caught up to member behavior.

---

### Activity Requirement Tension

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I like having some of the community games be on other games, but to play those I have to also play all the time on destiny to stay in the clan. Just makes it hard to enjoy other games.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
It would be nice to have the clan open to playing other multiplayer games and not have to worry about getting removed because I'm not on Destiny as much anymore.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I wish that there was a way for us to track/count time spent in games if we are spending time with a member of the SGC... A way for us to enjoy our times together and have it all count towards our activity.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I like the group in Bastion, I just wish it didn't have its own set of participation rules that have to be met each week before you play with other sgc communities.
</div>

**The Paradox:** Activity requirements force Destiny grinding. Members feel trapped between what they want to do (play other games with SGC friends) and what they must do (play Destiny to keep clan membership or climb the leaderboards of POTW/POTM).

### Survival Imperative

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Destiny is dead, its getting beat by cookie clicker.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
The game is dead or is dying it's force fed from this 'GAMING COMMUNITY'.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I love this game, but this dlc destroyed my trust in bungie.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Stop with coping about it, accept reality and put that effort into something that will matter.
</div>

**Blunt Assessment:** Multiple members describe Destiny 2 as a "dying game". Continuing to tie SGC's identity exclusively to Destiny is seen as an overall bad decision.

</div>

## The Case for Staying Destiny-Focused (Minority View)

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Arguments Presented

**1. Identity and History**
- SGC was built on Destiny
- Community identity tied to the game
- Nostalgia and loyalty to roots

**2. Organizational Complexity**
- Managing one game is simpler
- Multi-gaming requires more structure
- Risk of diluting focus

**3. Hope for Destiny's Recovery**
- Some believe Bungie can turn it around
- Future DLCs might revive interest
- Don't abandon during rough patches or content drought

---

### Counter-Arguments to These Concerns

**Re: Identity and History**
<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
SGC as a whole is amazing to me and is dear to me, for it to be in the hands of bungie or destiny does not make me feel warm and fuzzy.
</div>
- Identity is the people that make the community, not the game
- History doesn't require stagnation
- Evolution preserves what matters (friendships)

**Re: Organizational Complexity**
<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Myself and several others do link up and play BF, TFD and Warframe.
</div>
- Already happening organically in certain clans
- Just needs official recognition
- Don't need to manage everything centrally

**Re: Hope for Destiny's Recovery**
<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
If destiny succeeds and revives itself which god I'm hoping it does. Id still love for other games.
</div>
- Multi-gaming doesn't abandon Destiny for good
- Keeps door open for Destiny's return
- Just doesn't bet entire community effort on it

</div>

## Activity Requirements: A Core Issue

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Current System Problems

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I like having some of the community games be on other games, but to play those I have to also play all the time on destiny to stay in the clan. Just makes it hard to enjoy other games.
</div>

**The Problem seen through the eyes of the community:** 
- Activity requirements are currently Destiny-specific
- Members must choose: play what they enjoy and risk being removed for inactivity OR maintain clan standing
- Creates resentment and burnout

## Destiny 2's Current State (Member Assessment)

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Destiny is dead, its getting beat by cookie clicker.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
The game is dead in my opinion.

</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
It doesn't help we are forced to play destiny 2 which is utterly and completely basically dead. Very very bad look for a community.
</div>

### The Grim Reality

**Members describe Destiny 2 as:** 
- Dead or dying
- Untrustworthy (Bungie and lack of their communication)
- Unenjoyable (Very grindy at times, Game has become stale)
- Only playing because of SGC requirement

**Members are here for SGC, NOT Destiny.** 
The game is currently obstacle, not the glue.

</div>

## The Timeline Question

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### How Urgent Is This?

<div class="alert alert-critical">
Members are unhappy, some even are thinking of leaving or have left already due to Destiny/Community stagnation.
If they are staying, they are doing so unhappily and sticking due to friendships/relationships.
</div>

**Evidence:**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I don't want SGC to die off with destiny.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
SGC needs to embrace being a community of people playing different games and working with that rather than trying to cling to a dying game and slowly dying with it.
</div>

**Assessment:**
- Members see this as existential
- Not a "nice to have" - a survival requirement
- Delay = attrition
- Window of opportunity is closing

**Members are patient, but not infinite.** 
They're asking for change as soon as possible.

</div>

## What Respondents Think Could Help

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Ideas from the Members' Perspective:

1. **Can play any game with SGC friends and it "counts"**
   - No forced Destiny grinding
   - Activity = community participation
   - Game choice is personal preference

2. **Community survives game lifecycle**
   - Not hostage to Bungie's decisions
   - Can pivot as gaming landscape changes
   - Future-proof structure

3. **Friendships preserved**
   <div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
   I don't want SGC to die off with destiny, I want to keep my close friends from here.
   </div>
   - Core motivation for most members
   - Community > game

4. **Events reflect what members play**
   - Multi-gaming recognition via Game News and Announcements
   - Events in popular games
   - Destiny still included but not exclusive

5. **Clear identity as gaming community**
   <div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
   Make this a gaming community not a destiny 2 community.
   </div>
   - Welcoming to players of many games
   - United by community, not by game

6. **Room for Destiny's potential return**
   <div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
   If destiny succeeds and revives itself which god I'm hoping it does. Id still love for other games.
   </div>
   - Multi-gaming doesn't abandon Destiny
   - Can increase Destiny focus if game recovers
   - But not dependent on it

</div>
