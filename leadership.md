### What have respondents told us:

**General Thoughts from the Community:**

 - Some respondents perceive that certain leaders are prone to outbursts.
 - Others are bothered by some leaders making off-putting comments publicly (political and otherwise).
 - Others perceive favoritism shown to other members by certain leaders in Division Leader and Shrouded Admin roles.
 - Some leaders have been purported to show a pattern of mistreating members publicly.
 - Some respondents are concerned that some leaders have a pattern of exhibiting negative behavior that they cover for repeatedly with apologies and nothing more.
 - Some respondents note some staff are not held accountable when they themselves break or participate in breaking SGC rules.
 - Some have stated that Shrouded Admins can come off as condescending or rude so people are hesitant to come to them.
 - One among the Division Leaders can seem rigid, hesitant to change, and can be negative when approached.
 - Greener can seem too busy since he can be unresponsive to DMs.
 - Some members feel targeted by one of the Shrouded Admins.
 - One or two leaders seem to have little to no presence since respondents' comments are just "I'm not familiar with this person" or "I don't know them."
 - Some leaders seem volatile in that they can be friendly one moment, moody and harsh the next.
 - Some leaders seem more concerned about wielding power and influence than helping members or caring for the community.
 - Other leaders can seem more focused on financial gain.
 - Some respondents appear to be bothered by leadership broadcasting negative sentiment against members as blind items on community podcasts/streams.
 - A portion of respondents appear to have negative sentiments around how certain leaders have handled events.
 - One respondent voiced a desire to see more interaction from Lead Sherpas as far as hopping in to support in-clan raids.

#### **What about Sherpas?**

Sherpas are a breed all their own, and the lead sherpas personify that. It takes a certain kind of person to learn how to do something and then be willing to teach other people.
Our interactions with the Lead Sherpas tend to be limited unless someone formally requests a sherpa run. This creates a gap in accessibility, specifically for clan members who only need refreshers on specific raids. 
A possible solution would be to give lead sherpas access to each clan’s raiding schedule or LFG activity, which would allow them to proactively identify opportunities to assist and offer guidance to players who may be struggling/looking to improve.

### Approachability by Role - Analysis by Position

| Role | Average Approachability | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| **Division Leaders** | 4.5/5 | Highest rated group |
| **Clan Admins** | 4.2/5 | Generally accessible |
| **Clan Officers** | 4.0/5 | Variable by clan |
| **Moderators** | 4.3/5 | Mixed but mostly positive |
| **SGC Admins** | 3.2/5 | Wide variance, some concerns |
| **Founder/Streamers** | 3.8/5 | Time-constrained but friendly |

**Pattern:** Leadership closer to members (Division Leaders, Clan Admins) rate higher than top-level SGC Admins.

**Why?**
- More direct interaction
- Better understanding of member needs
- More visible accountability
- Personal relationships
