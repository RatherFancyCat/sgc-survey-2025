## Leadership Concerns

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Critical Issues Identified

<div class="alert alert-critical" markdown="1">
<strong>PRIORITY 1:</strong> Specific leadership behavior patterns requiring immediate attention
</div>

#### **Mister Wrecked (Admin) - Major Concern**

**Frequency of Negative Mentions:** Very High (~15-20% of all feedback)

**Pattern of Complaints:**
1. Power abuse
2. Favoritism
3. Hypocrisy
4. Poor attitude
5. Unapproachable demeanor
6. Ego issues

**Sample Feedback:**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Wrecked he's lousy at being an admin he's cruel unfair and unreasonable most times. I feel that he should have never been giving any form of power and should be stripped of it immediately he's an extreme detriment to this gaming community.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
The only one that needs gone from that list is wrecked he shouldn't have any form of power he brings the whole community down. He's a bad person a hypocrite, liar and overall bad dude.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
From what I see in chats and have experienced both wrecked and Hoppe are very egotistical fake and absolutely rude.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Make this a gaming community not a destiny 2 community and get wrecked out of power it's bad for business!
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
It's a very unpleasant atmosphere... having wrecked in that form of power will completely crush the SGC.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
A good leader lifts the entire team, not just a select few. If Wrecked doesn't want to be a good leader, but continue on his current role, then consider giving the role to someone who genuinely cares about the community.
</div>

**Specific Incident - Clan Wars Messaging:**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Clan Wars seemed like an event that would be something that would have the Clans duking it out in the spirit of competition and then next thing you know we have the event organizer coming in and telling us that it was meant to be a community building event. Not a competition. What a joke.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Competitive events are good and all but the way Clan Wars got handled and was advertised just fell flat and makes me think that Wrecked is being a sanctimonious prick about it.
</div>

**Counter-Perspective (Minority View):**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Wrecked is cool af the 'role abusing pussy' he has the power & I've seen him 1st hand he will use it in the funniest of ways great dude.
</div>

**Assessment:** While one person defended him, the volume and consistency of negative feedback suggests a serious leadership problem that requires investigation.

---

#### **Other Leadership Concerns**

**Hoppe (mentioned with Wrecked):**
<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
From what I see in chats and have experienced both wrecked and Hoppe are very egotistical fake and absolutely rude.
</div>

**Jango (Trust Issue):**
<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I don't trust Jango, who broke a critical core rule of the SGC and kept his role.
</div>
- Accountability concern
- Perception of double standards

**Inactive Leadership:**
<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
The clan is dead, and there is zero activity from the officers. They don't even touch anything destiny related.
</div>
- Multiple clans mentioned having inactive officers/admins
- Rise specifically called out repeatedly

</div>

---

## Favoritism & Accountability

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Systemic Issues

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
<strong>PATTERN IDENTIFIED:</strong> Perception that rules apply differently to staff vs regular members
</div>

**Evidence from Feedback:**

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Favoritism is clear within the SGC Admins from my perspective.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I get they are all friends, but at the end of the day the admins should be treated like managers of a job, if they are wrong they should be punished, not ban the people that spoke up.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
Members of staff (Officer and up) breaking SGC Code of Conduct and getting a slap on the wrist when others would have been kicked/banned. Rules are seemingly lax when a staff member is the offender.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
I don't trust Jango, who broke a critical core rule of the SGC and kept his role.
</div>

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
And where are the moderators or admin staff? They are silent. In fact they mainly support her. (re: NSFW content issue)
</div>

### Impact of Favoritism

**Erosion of Trust:**
- Members lose faith in leadership fairness
- Perception that speaking up leads to retaliation
- "Friends of admins" get special treatment

**Morale Impact:**
- Regular members feel rules don't apply equally
- Discourages reporting issues
- Creates "us vs them" mentality

**Accountability Gap:**
- Staff violations not addressed
- Inconsistent enforcement
- Double standards breed resentment

</div>

### What Works Well

**✅ Division Leader System:**

- Clans suffer from leadership neglect

**❌ Consistent Standards:**

## Approachability by Role

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Analysis by Position

| Role | Average Approachability | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| **Division Leaders** | 4.5/5 | Highest rated group |
| **Clan Admins** | 4.2/5 | Generally accessible |
| **Clan Officers** | 4.0/5 | Variable by clan |
| **Moderators** | 4.3/5 | Mixed but mostly positive |
| **SGC Admins** | 3.2/5 | Wide variance, some concerns |
| **Founder/Streamers** | 3.8/5 | Time-constrained but friendly |

**Pattern:** Leadership closer to members (Division Leaders, Clan Admins) rate higher than top-level SGC Admins.

**Why?**
- More direct interaction
- Better understanding of member needs
- More visible accountability
- Personal relationships

</div>

## Trust Metrics

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Do Members Trust Leadership?

**Mixed Results:**

**Trust Present:**
- In individual clan leaders (high)
- In specific staff (Xiamara, Devilito, etc.)
- In Division Leader system

**Trust Absent:**
- In consistent rule enforcement (low)
- In accountability for staff violations (very low)
- In specific individuals (critical concerns)
- In "mega-clan" leadership structure

<div class="quote-box" markdown="1">
We don't really trust the word of the SGC admins anymore and typically avoid them unless absolutely necessary.
</div>

This quote from Wraiths members summarizes a broader sentiment: **Trust in local leadership remains, but trust in SGC-level leadership is eroding.**
