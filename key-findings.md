## Most Critical Findings

<div class="alert alert-critical">

### 1. Existential Crisis: Multi-Gaming Evolution

**Finding:** 75% of members want SGC to become a multi-gaming community.

**Why It Matters:** Destiny 2 is declining. Members are already playing other games together but activity requirements force Destiny grinding. This creates resentment and will lead to attrition.

**Action Required:** Immediate policy reform to recognize multi-gaming activity and prevent community dissolution.

</div>

<div class="alert alert-critical">

### 2. Leadership Crisis: Specific Behavioral Concerns

**Finding:** One admin (Mister Wrecked) received extensive negative feedback (~15-20% of respondents).

**Why It Matters:** Pattern of complaints about favoritism, power abuse, and poor attitude. Community trust in leadership is eroding.

**Action Required:** Investigation and potential leadership restructuring to restore confidence.

</div>

<div class="alert alert-critical">

### 3. Moderation Crisis: NSFW Content Failure

**Finding:** Serious moderation failure in Apex clan affecting member mental health.

**Why It Matters:** Rules not enforced, member driven away from clan channels. Staff allegedly supporting rule violations.

**Action Required:** Immediate investigation and consistent rule enforcement.

</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">

### 4. Cultural Crisis: Cross-Clan Division

**Finding:** 1.2 point gap between in-clan (4.4/5) and cross-clan (3.2/5) atmosphere ratings.

**Why It Matters:** SGC operates as 20 separate clans, not one community. Elitism and division undermine the "mega-clan" concept.

**Action Required:** Address elitism, create cross-clan opportunities, emphasize unified identity.

</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">

### 5. Accountability Gap: Double Standards

**Finding:** Widespread perception that rules apply differently to staff vs members.

**Why It Matters:** Erodes trust, discourages issue reporting, creates "us vs them" mentality.

**Action Required:** Transparent enforcement standards and accountability for all, including leadership.

</div>
