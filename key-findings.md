"I don’t want SGC to die off with destiny, I want to keep my close friends from here. That’s it. If destiny succeeds and revives itself which god I’m hoping it does. Id still love for other games, because SGC as a whole is amazing to me and is dear to me, for it to be I. The hands of bungie or destiny does not make me feel warm and fuzzy. So adding other games would benefit it for future proofing"
</div>

**Critical Finding:** Three-quarters of the community want SGC to evolve into a multi-gaming community. Members are staying for each other, not for Destiny.

## Most Critical Findings

<div class="alert alert-critical" markdown="1">

### 1. Existential Crisis: Multi-Gaming Evolution

**Finding:** 75% of respondents want SGC to become a multi-gaming community.

**Why It Matters:** Destiny 2 is declining. Members are already playing other games together but activity requirements force Destiny grinding. This creates and has created already some resentment and is causing attrition.

**Potential Readjustment:** Immediate policy reform to recognize multi-gaming activity and prevent community dissolution. Immediate policy reform to recognize multi-gaming activity and prevent community dissolution.
Immediate support for multi-gaming structures within clans and shifting towards more multi-gaming oriented community events.

</div>

<div class="alert alert-critical" markdown="1">

### 2. Leadership Crisis: Specific Behavioral Concerns

**Finding:** A Shrouded Admin received extensive negative feedback (~15-20% of respondents).

**Why It Matters:** Pattern of complaints about favoritism, power abuse, and poor attitude. Community trust in leadership is eroding.

**Potential Readjustment:** Investigation of reports, leadership-level reflection and readjustment to restore confidence

</div>

<div class="alert alert-critical" markdown="1">

### 3. Moderation Crisis: NSFW Content Failure

**Finding:** Failure in moderation in certain clans resulting in hypersexualized chats that make members uncomfortable to the point where they either block people or consider leaving.

**Why It Matters:** Rules not enforced, members driven away from clan channels. Staff seeming to support and take part in rule violations. Unfair preferential treatment.

**Potential Readjustment:** Staff should examine their clan environments and address issues immediately. Make it clear to members that clan chats and VCs should be a cozy space for ALL members. Enforcing SGC rules help maintain that space. Division Leaders to check in with Admins regarding this. 

</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">

### 4. Cultural Crisis: Cross-Clan Division

**Finding:** 1.2 point gap between in-clan (4.4/5) and cross-clan (3.2/5) atmosphere ratings.

**Why It Matters:** SGC operates as 20 separate clans, not one community. On the one hand, it is clear that clan members seem to thrive in in-clan atmosphere. They are more at ease there. On the other hand, coming together as a community also supports and helps maintain a pleasant atmosphere in larger spheres such as LFG channels and activities.

**Potential Readjustment:** Encourage organic positive cross-clan interactions in LFG and community-wide events so people naturally get to know one another. Manufactured or forced cross-clan interactions are discouraged since it takes away members' safehavens in their own clans and historically, poaching accusations wind up causing bad blood between clan staff.

</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">

### 5. Accountability Gap: Double Standards

**Finding:** Members believe that Staff Members can bypass or break rules without any repercussion, whilst actively enforcing rules on Members.

**Why It Matters:** This creates an environment of distrust between Members and Staff, ensures that our goal of "Communication is Key" does not get met, and creates a cycle of fighting to get a Staff position to do unto others what has been done to me.

**Potential Readjustment:** Establish set core of checks and balances // rules and directives, for Staff Members, including a system of Warnings, Demotion or Removal of Staff Positions. Visible by the community, and reportable by members and peers.
