## How This Data Is Presented:
<div class="alert alert-critical" markdown="1">
This report contains data from the survey, but mentions of specific people have been obscured to protect the anonymity of SGC members. The intent is to examine what things we're doing right and what things need readjustment, and having specific individuals mentioned in a report that goes out to the whole server would only serve to create opportunities for humiliation and passing blame.

Rest assured, Greener himself received a copy of your voluntary feedback without these redactions since for him, it IS essential to know specifics.

Certain feedback on specific clans or mention of issues with specific clan mates will be distributed to the appropriate clan admins via their Division Leaders so that they maybe investigated and addressed promptly. Some pressing issues have in fact already been directed to clan admins in this manner in cases that seemed urgent.

## What Happens Now?
<div class="alert alert-critical" markdown="1">
Leadership will be meeting to reflect on the survey results and to create a plan of attack as far as necessary adjustments, investigations, mediation, and solutions.

We understand and respect that each member's concern is urgent, however since not everything can be addressed at once, we ask for your patience as we prioritize the most critical feedback and work our way from there.

Your clan staff will be looped in on plans of actions and Division Leaders will work closely with admins to ensure they have support where needed. As always, we will be taking feedback from clan staff so if at any moment you have concerns or questions, please pass them to your admin since usually they will know the answer or have direct contact with their Division Leader who can help with clarification. This chain is to make sure we are all on the same page - SGC upper leadership, clan leadership, and members alike, as we move forward to better and to secure the future of the SGC.

## A Personal Thank you for you.
<div class="alert alert-warning">
I, Rather Fancy Cat, want to personally thank each person who filled out the Survey back in October, but I also want to apologize to everyone.
This took a long time to be released as I stated to the public.

A Very Special thanks to Xiamara, whose help, effort, writting skills and persistence were fundamental to the successful completion of the data handling you will be seeing in this platform.

Thank you all so much!
