## What Happens Next?
### For Leadership
Hopefully, for us, the leaders behind the SGC, this is immensely important to understand how you, the people who make the SGC what it is, feel how we are behaving ourselves.
A reality check, and oversight is needed. I think I speak for Greener when I thank you all for the years of cooperation.

### For Members
I, Rather Fancy Cat, want to personally thank each person who filled out the Survey back in October, but I also want to apologize to everyone.
This took a long time to be released as I stated to the public.

Thank you all so much!
